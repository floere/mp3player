1. MP3 Player

Trying to hack together an mp3 player that is simple and easy to use.

What it should be able to do:
 * Have a memory stick opening.
 * Play randomly a sequence of mp3s from the memory stick.
 * Start playing when the memory stick is inserted and stop when removed.
 * Broadcast the music by RF.
 * Have a debugging display that is not shown.
 * Be made of darkly textured wood. A pillar with the opening at the top.
